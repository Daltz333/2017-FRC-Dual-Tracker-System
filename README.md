# Dual Tracking System for the 2017 FRC Game
	The Dual Tracking System for the 2017 FRC Game SteamWorks was developed by
	Dalton Smith of Robotics Team 66. It was designed to be used with an axis camera
	and a RaspberryPi3 but can be easily changed to work with USB cameras. Code can be
	run on any co-processor with python and opencv capabilities.

## Program Goals:
	*Code is completely modular and adaptable.
	*Code is simple to use and well commented.
	*Code is reusable.

## To Note:
	*Vision tracking for Tower is ^^UNTESTED^^
	*Prefered IP setup is static IP, untested for MDNS
